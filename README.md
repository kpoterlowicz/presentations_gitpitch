## Presenting slides

- `F` for Full screen

## Developing slides

Slides must be in a file named `PITCHME.md`

`https://gitpitch.com/$user/$repo/$branch?p=$subdirectory`

- [Offline Slideshow](https://github.com/gitpitch/gitpitch/wiki/Slideshow-Offline)



### Offline development

Using docker (gitpitch + gitlab), full instructions [here](docker/)

```bash
$ cd docker
$ docker-compose up
```

Use inotify to push changes to local gitpitch on every modification of slide.

From the slides folder do:

```
while inotifywait -r --exclude ".*.swp" -e modify . ; do git reset HEAD~ && git add PITCHME.md PITCHME.yaml ../assets/images/*  && git commit -m "add content" && git push -f gitpitch; done
```

- Be sure not to save again until the update and push has completed
- This will overwrite your last commit to keep history clean, use with care


### Set background image for a slide

```md
---?image=assets/image/lukas_blazek.jpg
```

### Code Snippets and Syntax Highlighting

```markdown
---?code=path/to/code.py&lang=python&title=Python File
```

### Include markdown file

NOTE: this only works for the top-level `PITCHME.md` file

```markdown
---?include=md/intro.md
```
